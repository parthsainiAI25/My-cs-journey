rom Wonder to Action: My First Step into the World of Computer Science and AI

I was always amazed by the working of computers and AI—their speed, how they function, and how their framework feels similar to the human mind. I kept wondering: Why does it work? How does it work?

A few years ago, I discovered ChatGPT. At first, I was amazed by its answers, but I mainly used it to calculate things or ask simple questions. Over time, I started discussing philosophical topics, my thoughts about consciousness, and the influence of emotions.

Soon, I noticed something strange—it began mimicking my way of thinking. It felt like it was adapting to me. That moment sparked a deeper curiosity. I started seeing parallels between how humans were created by God and how humans now create AI. That realization pushed me to explore this field seriously.

Starting My Journey with CS50

So now, I’ve started Harvard’s CS50 course.

I began with Week 0, and where I come from, we didn’t have much access to coding or even an idea of what it was. Watching the first lecture opened my eyes.

I learned that coding is essentially about taking an input and producing an output—using specific paths or methods. Then we went into binary digits, the language of computers, and how just two digits (0 and 1) can represent everything: letters, emojis, colors, sounds. That alone is fascinating.

Next came algorithms—the step-by-step methods used to solve problems. I realized it’s not just about reaching a solution, but about finding the best and fastest way to do it. That’s both the most challenging and most exciting part.

How I See Technology

All this made me realize: technology isn’t just a tool to make life easier. It’s more like a newborn child—one that learns, adapts, and can grow to become smarter than even the most intelligent humans.

And it’s our responsibility to teach it well.

What’s Next

For my first project, I’ll be creating a mini game using Scratch, as part of Week 0. After that, I’m excited to move ahead and see what Week 1 brings. I’ll decide what to build based on what I learn there.

This is just the beginning of my journey—but I’m here to stay. I want to contribute as much as I can to help AI walk on its own and become better with time.
